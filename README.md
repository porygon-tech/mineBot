# mineBot
Open source bot for Minecraft on Windows.

## Features to be implemented
Keystroke and video recording (during minecraft gameplays). Data will be used to train a LSTM CNN in tensorflow. Hopefully, the application will be able to eventually control a minecraft player in a human-like way. Reinforcement learning is currently a discarded option (maybe too hard to implement in minecraft with my current knowledge).
